We are using RTMP and OBS to render videos here
RTMP stands for Real Time Messaging Protocol
OBS stands for Open Broadcaster System
We have a RTMP server running (node js) which recieves data/video from OBS
We make a call from React App to our RTMP server which is receiving the live stream from OBS and renders it

// RTMP Server
const NodeMediaServer = require('node-media-server');
 
const config = {
  rtmp: {
    port: 1935,
    chunk_size: 60000,
    gop_cache: true,
    ping: 30,
    ping_timeout: 60
  },
  http: {
    port: 8000,
    allow_origin: '*'
  }
};
 
var nms = new NodeMediaServer(config)
nms.run();
